OpenStreetMap's road data coverage for Dhaka does not include many smaller roads and recently updated roads. With the inclusion of this newer, highly detailed dataset, OpenStreetMap would become much stronger.

<script>
var opts = {
  lat: {{ page.center[0].lat }},
  lon: {{ page.center[0].lon }},
  zoom: {
    defaultZoom:{{ page.center[0].zoom }},
    max:18,
    min:13
    }
  };

$(function() {
  gfdrr.generateMap('{{page.map}}', opts);
});
</script>
