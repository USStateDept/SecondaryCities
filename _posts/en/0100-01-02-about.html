        Mapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency, Human Security, and Emergency Preparedness is a project designed to build local capacity in using geospatial science and technology to create data in support of emergency preparedness. Globally, secondary cities are unique environments that are experiencing rapid urbanization and have generally been poorly mapped, yet mapping these cities is an essential activity in building resiliency, planning and managing urban growth, and devising robust emergency management plans.</p>
        The project will identify countries with rapidly growing secondary cities where governments have recognized their challenges and are looking to develop policies and programs to foster manageable growth and development. Projects will be implemented in secondary citiesâ€”typically non-primary cities with a population ranging from 100,000 to 5 million. The specific emphasis for this project is focused on generating geospatial data for emergency preparedness, a key need in the development of secondary cities. Projects teams will compose of local university academics and students with a focus in geospatial science, regional non-governmental organizations, and partners from local municipalities. Long-term training programs will be designed to build capacity around generating geospatial data from local knowledge, commercial satellite imagery, and other geographic tools.
