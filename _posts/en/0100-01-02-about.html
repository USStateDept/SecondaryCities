        Mapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency and Emergency Preparedness is a project designed to build local capacity in using geospatial science and technology to create data in support of emergency preparedness. Secondary cities are unique environments that are experiencing rapid urbanization and have generally been poorly mapped with limited data and information on infrastructure, land tenure, emergency preparedness, and planning.  </p>
        Mapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency and Emergency Preparedness builds local capacity in using open source and industry geospatial technologies, strengthens international partnerships, and creates new data in Secondary Cities that are frequently data-poor, under-resourced, and lagging behind in the provision of infrastructure and essential services. This project targets countries with rapidly growing secondary cities where governments have recognized their challenges and are looking to develop policies and programs to foster manageable growth and development. </p> Vulnerable populations in new and ungoverned urban spaces are environments that are potential sources of conflict, poverty, and security issues.  Mapping these cities is an essential activity in building resiliency and devising robust emergency management plans to address critical security issues.
