There are dozens of power plants throughout Sri Lanka fueling its citizens. An overwhelming number of these plants are concentrated around Sri Lanka’s largest city, Colombo. Although the energy production centers are close to their consumers, their proximity has associated risks. Spatial data about the location of the city’s energy infrastructure could aid in the planning of future generation facilities in locations that are both safe and central.
